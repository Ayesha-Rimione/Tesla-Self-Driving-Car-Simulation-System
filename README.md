# Tesla-Self-Driving-Car-Simulation-System

A C# Windows Forms–based simulation project developed for the course **Visual Programming (CSC 439)**.

This application simulates the operational control of autonomous vehicles, including mission execution, battery failure incidents, real-time alerts, and fleet monitoring through a graphical user interface.

## Features
- Autonomous car entity modeling with operational validation
- Custom exception handling for critical battery failure
- Delegate-based event system for real-time alerts
- LINQ-based fleet data management
- Interactive Windows Forms control panel

## Technologies Used
- C# (.NET, Windows Forms)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Delegates & Events
- Exception Handling
- LINQ

## How to Run
1. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the project
3. Add vehicle data using the UI
4. Simulate incidents to observe alerts and status changes

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of a university assignment to demonstrate visual programming concepts and system-level problem analysis in a real-world simulation scenario.
